# ProblemSet

This is a problem that involves the use of Interface and Abstract classes to create a simple shape calculator

The Problem is to calculate the Area and Volume of Circle and Sphere.

Now I have made the problem Open Ended, so that you must come up with a solution completely with your own with the following constraints:

* **There must be use of Interface**

* **There must be use of Abstract class**

* **There must be use of the concept of Inheritance**

* **There must be use of Math library for calculation of all sorts**

* **All the codes is to be written in the package called ProblemSet**
